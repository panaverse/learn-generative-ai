# International Certifications in Cloud Native Aritificial Intelegence (CNAI) for You

[Cloud Native (CN)](https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/cloud_native_ai24_031424a-2.pdf) and [Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI)](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/generative-AI) are the most critical technology trends today. Cloud Native technology provides a scalable and reliable platform for running applications and AI makes these applications smart. Our mission is to train you to become the world's best Cloud Native AI developers in the world. 

The Cloud Native Applied Generative AI Certification program trains you to be able to develop world-class and modern [Cloud Native AI]() solutions using the all-in-one [cloud-native](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/cloud-native/) and AI platform.

Cloud native is a software approach that allows for the development, deployment, and management of applications in cloud computing environments. Cloud-native applications are software programs that consist of multiple small, interdependent services called microservices. Traditionally, developers built monolithic applications with a single block structure containing all the required functionalities. By using the cloud-native approach, software developers break the functionalities into smaller microservices. This makes cloud-native applications more agile as these microservices work independently and take minimal computing resources to run. 

Cloud native services use technologies like Kubernetes, Docker, serverless containers and functions, APIs, SQL Databases, and Kafka to help developers build applications faster. These services provide a standards-based platform for building, deploying, and managing cloud native applications.

Cloud-native applications are designed to work across the cloud including Azure, Google Cloud, and AWS, both embedded in its architecture and facilitating cloud access. 

Spotify is an example of a cloud-native application that uses cloud services and container orchestration to handle the vast music catalog, deliver personalized recommendations, and support millions of concurrent users across various devices.

Our program will also gets you ready to be able to pass international certifications to showcase and validate your skills globally.
